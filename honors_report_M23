### Abstract

The initial goal of this honours project was to learn regarding Indian accents and study about them in the non-native context. A major part of the project focused on literature review and a conceptual level understanding from a linguistic perspective as to what constitutes an accent and what contributes to the meaning. Following this were a few attempted paper implementation across data formats i.e. global level embeddings like word2vec and GloVe which do not capture any local contextual representations to SAMU-XLSR and Speech2Vec, which capture audio level information and multilingual correlation among languages.



### Introduction

In today's world, speech applications are perhaps one of the fastest growing technologies, with several companies like Google (with their Assistant), Amazon (Alexa), Apple (Siri), Microsoft (Cortana) being used by an ever-increasing share of the population. What makes them very popular is the ease of operating them and to a great extent, also owing to their high levels of precision and accuracy. 

Though these are all very fascinating applications, a majority of the Indian rural or uneducated population is not able to enjoy the benefits of sophistication in speech technology like ASRs (Automatic Speech Recognizer), TTS(Text-to-Speech). Here, the problem is that the model themselves are not very useful especially in case of detecting a non-native accent or speech utterance, as they are trained pre-dominantly on native speakers' data. 

This leads to a large percentage of the population missing out on all these facilities because of few dialectal and accent variations.
